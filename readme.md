# StreamerMode for your Browser

I just leaked all of my personal information one too many times on Twitch by opening a website that showed all of my personal information to the world. This Chrome plugin solves that by replacing all of my personal information when i'm on stream.


## What it does

There's a few things combined in this plugin:
 - replaces sensitive information like full name, street, zip code, phone number, email
 - blurs the entire website while loading so nothing can slip through the cracks while rendering
 - *disables autofill for forms*
 
 *italic == not done yet*

## How to use it?
I'll fill this out once it has a proper UI. Still very much a work in progress.
